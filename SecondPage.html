<p> I am also like multiple other games from different genre of other games such as Pokemon,
    Fortnite, Devil May Cry, Persona and other more.</p>

<p>While some I have just gotten into Pokemon and Fortnite I have played early when I was younger
and Fortnite when I was almost 11.</p>

<p>My favorite Pokemon game would have to be Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and I also like Gen 3
    as my all time favorite starter is Treecko and you can learn more here</p>
